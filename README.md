# HTML Forms
This project was a (re)-introduction to creating forms. Having used forms in Rails, the majority of this process was familiar. However, there were still new things to learn in terms of semantic HTML and basic styling with CSS.

The form was made to look similar to [this Intuit form](https://accounts.intuit.com/signup.html), minus the icons. The most important thing was the page structure and layout.

## How to run (local)
I doubt that I will have a Github pages for this project, so if you want to run it do the following:
1. Clone this repo (`git clone git@github.com:qamk/html-forms.git`)
2. Navigate into the folder (e.g. `cd html-forms` or open the folder)
3. Open the `index.html` file (in your browser)

## Final comments
There weren't any stand-out resources to include or things to discuss, this project was a good way to focus on the design and implementation of forms, without emphasis on the backend. However, I do recommend that, if you do any work with CSS/HTML that you use **emmet**. You'll have to search how to activate it in your chosen text-editor, but you can usually find it somewhere in settings.
